KNOWN BUGS:


* Problem: The document is not always fully converted at first pass.

  Explanation: This is because of the current way of processing text
  portions to reduce format loss. A new way is currently investigated.

  Solution: run the conversion twice, it's usually enough.


* Problem: Sometime the clipboard content doesn't get converted.

  Explanation: We found out that OpenOffice.org doesn't always keep
  the font information when doing a copy-to-clipboard operation.

  Solution: paste the content in a new document, set the correct font
  and then run a document convertion.
