KNOWN BUGS:

* Problem: Sometime the clipboard content doesn't get converted.

  Explanation: We found out that OpenOffice.org doesn't always keep
  the font information when doing its copy-to-clipboard operation.

  Solution: Paste the content into a new document, select the content,
  then set the correct font, and finally run a document convertion.

* Problem: Sometime the header/footer content doesn't get converted.

  Explanation: We found out that OpenOffice.org doesn't correctly
  manage headers/footers in the 2nd section and the followings.
  You can see that when saving such document as ODT: it will loose
  header/footer from 2nd section and followings. We reported this
  as a bug: http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=107200

  Solution: We currently don't know any good and/or easy solution.
  For now, you have to go to every concerned header/footer, select
  the still-not-converted text and use the clipboard conversion.
  Still, because of this OpenOffice.org bug, you will loose either
  the sections (saving as DOC) or the header/footer (saving as ODT).
