KNOWN BUGS:

* Problem: Sometime the clipboard content doesn't get converted.

  Explanation: We found out that OpenOffice.org doesn't always keep
  the font information when doing a copy-to-clipboard operation.

  Solution: Paste the content into a new document, select the content,
  then set the correct font, and finally run a document convertion.

* Problem: Sometime the header/footer content doesn't get converted.

  Explanation: We found out that OpenOffice.org doesn't correctly
  headers/footers in the 2nd section and the followings. You can see
  that when saving such document as ODT, it will loose header/footer
  from 2nd section and followings. We reported that as a bug here:
    http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=107200

  Solution: We don't know of a good and easy solution currently.
  For now, you have to go in every concerned header/footer to select
  the unconverted text and use the clipboard conversion function.
  Still, because of this OpenOffice.org bug, you will loose either
  the sections (saving as DOC) or the header/footer (saving as ODT).
